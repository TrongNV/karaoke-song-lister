# Karaoke Song List App

This is a React-Rudux app that connects with a REST API to provide an interface for users to search and browse karaoke songs. This app is still in its infancy, so instructions for how to run the project, contribute, or report issues are incoming. You can see the app in action at [karaoke.lividliquid.com](https://karaoke.lividliquid.com).

## About
This project is primarily developed and maintained for [LividLiquid Productions](https://www.lividliquid.com/) in Seattle, WA, but you are free to use it in your own karaoke business.

## With Thanks
Many thanks to the [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) project for giving me a great starting point for building this project.
